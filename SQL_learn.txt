Code:

SELECT name 
FROM Customer
WHERE COALESCE(referee_id, 0) != 2;

COALESCE will check and replace all null values with 0 and the condition will be checked with referee_id not equal to 2.

Code:

select name, population, area
from ( select name, population, area,
    case 
        when area >= 3000000 then true
        when population >= 25000000 then true 
        else false
        end as is_bigger from world) has_big
where is_bigger >0

Using case and when instead of just a where filter ran faster.

Code:

SELECT tweet_id
FROM (SELECT tweet_id, LENGTH(content) AS length_of_character FROM Tweets) AS invalid_tweet
WHERE length_of_character > 15;

LENGTH() : returns the length of the text in bytes
